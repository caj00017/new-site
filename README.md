# cjones.dev

Hi! My name is Chris Jones. I'm creating this website to serve as an interactive portfolio/resume detailing my work/study experience and other things I've worked on.
This is the code repository for my site. When development is complete, I will move the code to a new repository and make this one private. 

The content of my website can be viewed at https://cjones.dev

Contact/resume information is currently available on the site.
